Title: Hospital Management System

Description:
The Hospital Management System is a C++ based software designed to streamline the patient management process in a hospital setting. It provides an intuitive interface for managing patients across various departments, enabling healthcare professionals to efficiently organize patient data and ensure smooth operations.

Key Features:

Department Management: The system supports multiple departments, allowing administrators to create, modify, and manage various units within the hospital, such as General Clinic, Heart Clinic, Lung Clinic, and Plastic Surgery.

Patient Data Management: Users can input and store essential patient information, including first name, last name, age, blood group, gender, and mobile number. The system ensures data integrity and easy access to patient records.

Patient Queuing: Patients can be added to the queue either at the beginning (for critically ill patients) or at the end (for regular patients). The queue follows a linked list-based data structure, providing efficient management of patient flow.

Patient-Doctor Interaction: The system enables hospital staff to assign patients to doctors, facilitating seamless communication and coordination between healthcare providers and patients.

Search and Listing: The Hospital Management System allows users to search for specific patients by their mobile number and displays a comprehensive list of patients in each department. This feature aids in quick retrieval of patient information and efficient record-keeping.

Access Control: The system implements access control through login credentials to ensure secure data management. Administrators and authorized personnel can access the system after entering their unique IDs and passwords.

User-Friendly Interface: The software features a simple and user-friendly interface that allows even non-technical staff to use it with ease. Menus and options are clearly presented for seamless navigation.

Error Handling: The program incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle invalid input, ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing unexpected program crashes.

The Hospital Management System provides an effective solution for hospitals to streamline patient management, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall operational efficiency. Its modular design makes it adaptable for use in hospitals of varying sizes and specializations. By centralizing patient data, it empowers healthcare professionals to deliver improved patient care and enhance patient outcomes.

(Note: The project assumes basic knowledge of C++ programming. While the system offers essential functionality for patient management, further enhancements and features can be added to meet specific hospital requirements.)
